Chapter I - Our story begins

When play begins:

Your Home is a room. "A cosy place."
The player is in Your Home.
The Amulet is in Your Home.

	say "'What is going on, Rain?'";
	say "'Burnspring the Sorcerous trapped the magician's guild in a powerful spell, the city is powerless against him!' he pants.";
	say "'My help? I make jewelry, how in the name of Anerat can I help?', you feel uneasy.";
	say "Rain steadies himself, 'Our magicians are trapped, to be sure, and I fear I will be taken soon.'";
	say "Rain holds out an amulet for you to take.";

[NOTES
Test if the player has been here before with [if unvisited]. A room is considered to be "unvisited" until after the player has seen its description for the first time.

A more verbose alternative, and demonstrating we can even test if another room has been visited: [if the Hill Path is unvisited].

We can also use [if the player is in the Hill Path for the first time] but this will only adapt the text after the player leaves and re-enters the room.
]
The Hill Path is a room. "[if the Hill Path is unvisited]There is shrubbery and trees around you. You can hear water flowing, but cannot see much through the dense foliage. [end if]Town is due south, you have no need to go back there right now."

A wooden door is a door. The description is "A sturdy wooden door that leads outside." It is outside from Your Home. Through it is the Hill Path. [a one-sided door only leading out]
Instead of opening a wooden door when the player is not carrying the Amulet:
	say "Best you take the amulet with you."
